    # Demonstrate truncation-based reduction, there are two important settings to consider:
    # reducer_msg_count:
    #   Purpose: Defines the target number of messages to retain after applying truncation or summarization.
    #   What it controls: This parameter determines how much of the most recent conversation history
    #                   is preserved while discarding or summarizing older messages.
    #   Why change it?:
    #   - Smaller values: Use when memory constraints are tight, or the assistant only needs a brief history
    #   to maintain context.
    #   - Larger values: Use when retaining more conversational context is critical for accurate responses
    #   or maintaining a richer dialogue.
    # reducer_threshold:
    #   Purpose: Acts as a buffer to avoid reducing history prematurely when the current message count exceeds
    #          reducer_msg_count by a small margin.
    #   What it controls: Helps ensure that essential paired messages (like a user query and the assistantâ€™s response)
    #                   are not "orphaned" or lost during truncation or summarization.
    #   Why change it?:
    #   - Smaller values: Use when you want stricter reduction criteria and are okay with possibly cutting older
    #   pairs of messages sooner.
    #   - Larger values: Use when you want to minimize the risk of cutting a critical part of the conversation,
    #   especially for sensitive interactions like API function calls or complex responses.

# Interaction between reducer_msg_count and reducer_threshold:
# The combination of these values determines when reduction occurs and how much history is kept.
# Example:
# If reducer_msg_count = 10 and reducer_threshold = 5, history will not be truncated until the total message count
# exceeds 15. This approach ensures flexibility in retaining conversational context while still adhering to memory
# constraints.

# Recommendations:
# - Adjust for performance: Use a lower reducer_msg_count in environments with limited memory or when the assistant
#   needs faster processing times.
# - Context sensitivity: Increase reducer_msg_count and reducer_threshold in use cases where maintaining continuity
#   across multiple interactions is essential (e.g., multi-turn conversations or complex workflows).
# - Experiment: Start with the default values (10 and 10) and refine based on your application's behavior and the
#   assistant's response quality.
